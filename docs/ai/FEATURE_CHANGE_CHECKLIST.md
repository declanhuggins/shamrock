# AI Feature Change Checklist

This checklist standardizes how AI agents add or change features in SHAMROCK.

Goal: keep changes safe, documented, and consistent with system invariants.

## 1. Define the Feature Boundary
Before writing or changing any implementation:
- Write a one-sentence purpose.
- List surfaces touched (frontend tabs, backend tabs, forms).
- List who uses it (end user vs operator).
- Identify entry points (menu actions, triggers, form submit events).

## 2. Confirm System Invariants
Every feature must comply with docs/system/SYSTEM_SPEC.md.

Confirm explicitly:
- Provisioning is idempotent ensure-exists (safe to re-run).
- Tables use row 1 machine headers and start data tables at row 2.
- Column access is header-driven (no hardcoded column indexes).
- Dropdowns and validations reference Data Legend ranges.
- Forms require verified responder emails.
- Frontend tables are protected; edits flow through forms/logic.

## 3. Document First (Public)
Update docs/public/README.md before implementing.

Required in the public entry:
- Overview and operators/end-users.
- User entry points (forms, menu actions, triggers).
- Data touched (tabs and key columns by header name).
- Provisioning notes (what setup ensures and how it remains safe).
- Validation checklist (manual steps and expected visible outcomes).
- Rollback guidance (how to disable triggers or revert derived state).

Never include:
- Raw sheet IDs, form IDs, personal emails, or personal data.

## 4. Document Supporting Internal Changes
Update internal docs when applicable:
- Update docs/system/SYSTEM_SPEC.md if any system-wide invariant changes.
- Update docs/runbooks/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md if operator steps or recovery steps change.

## 5. Segment the Implementation (Design-Only Guidance)
When implementation is created later, keep boundaries consistent:
- Parsing and validating form responses belongs in src/forms.
- Sheet read/write helpers belong in src/sheets.
- Orchestration and business rules belong in src/services.
- Entry points and trigger installation belong in src/triggers.
- Shared contracts belong in src/types.ts.
- IDs, named ranges, and feature flags belong in src/config (no secrets committed).

Each feature should be explainable as:
- Entry point → service → sheet helpers → audit logging

## 6. Safety Review
Before marking a feature “ready” in docs:
- Confirm the change is reversible.
- Confirm provisioning can be re-run without duplicates.
- Confirm the feature does not require direct sheet edits by end users.
- Confirm audit logging expectations are described.

## 7. Validation Expectations
Every feature doc must include:
- A short “happy path” validation.
- At least one failure/edge-case validation.
- A post-deploy verification step (menus load, triggers present, forms functioning).
