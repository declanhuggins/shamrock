# Data Legend Ranges (Canonical Option Sets)

This document records the canonical option sets used for Google Sheets data validation (dropdowns) and form option lists.

- Audience: developers/operators maintaining the system.
- Scope: values only (no implementation details).
- Policy: these lists are *authoritative*. The Data Legend sheet in each workbook should reflect these lists via stable named ranges.

## Representation Rules
- Each option set should be stored as a single-column range (one value per row).
- Each option set should be exposed as a named range (name is stable; range coordinates may change).
- Do not inline long dropdown lists directly into validations; validations must reference a range.
- When changing lists, prefer additive changes (append) unless a controlled migration is planned.

## Named Range Registry (Recommended)
These are recommended stable names for the Data Legend workbook ranges.

- `AS_YEARS`
- `FLIGHTS`
- `SQUADRONS`
- `UNIVERSITIES`
- `DORMS`
- `HOME_STATES`
- `CIP_BROAD_AREAS`
- `CIP_CODES`
- `AFSC_OPTIONS`
- `FLIGHT_PATH_STATUSES`
- `ATTENDANCE_CODES`
- `EXCUSAL_DECISIONS`
- `EXCUSAL_STATUSES`

You may add additional named ranges as needed, but keep names consistent across environments.
