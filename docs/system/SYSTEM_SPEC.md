# SHAMROCK System Specification (Internal)

This document is the canonical, internal specification for the SHAMROCK Google Sheets + Google Forms system.

- Audience: developers and AI agents working in this repository.
- Scope: system-wide invariants and architecture rules that all features must follow.
- Non-goal: this is not an implementation guide and should not contain code.

If a feature document conflicts with this spec, this spec wins.

## 1. System Summary
SHAMROCK is an Apps Script system (TypeScript, V8 runtime) that provisions and operates a multi-workbook HR/accountability solution.

- Primary surfaces:
  - A Frontend Google Sheet workbook used by end users.
  - A Backend Google Sheet workbook used as the source of truth.
  - Google Forms (Attendance, Excusals) used for controlled data entry.
- Interaction model:
  - End users do not edit tables directly; edits flow through forms and scripted operations.
  - Admins operate the system via custom menus and controlled backend edits.

## 2. Provisioning Model (Idempotent Ensure-Exists)
Provisioning must be safe to re-run.

Definition:
- “Ensure-exists” means every setup function must be able to run multiple times and converge the environment toward the desired state.

Provisioning responsibilities:
- Create or locate required workbooks.
- Create or locate required tabs within each workbook.
- Ensure table headers exist in row 1 (machine-friendly stable header identifiers).
- Ensure the visible display header row (row 2) is set and can be edited without breaking logic.
- Ensure named ranges needed for validation are present.
- Ensure formatting and sheet protections exist (see UX standards).
- Create or locate required forms and ensure key settings (verified responder emails).
- Create or locate triggers and ensure menu entries exist.

Idempotency rules:
- Do not duplicate sheets, named ranges, triggers, or form items when re-run.
- Prefer deterministic resource naming.
- Where a resource exists but differs from desired state, setup should update it.
- Setup must avoid destructive operations unless explicitly invoked by an admin “reset” action.

## 3. Ownership and Source of Truth
### 3.1 Frontend Workbook
The frontend workbook is the user-facing UI layer.

- It contains locked tabs and “presentation-first” formatting.
- It mirrors authoritative data from the backend.

Edits:
- Direct edits to core data tables should be prevented with sheet protections.
- Exceptions (if needed) must be explicit and documented in the relevant feature entry.

### 3.2 Backend Workbook
The backend workbook is authoritative.

- Directory, Events, Excusals are maintained in the backend and propagated forward to the frontend.
- Attendance is derived from backend logs and decisions.

### 3.3 Cadre & Leadership Ownership (default)
Default ownership model:
- Backend is the source of truth for the Cadre & Leadership contact list.
- Frontend contains a read-only mirror.

Rationale:
- Centralizes authority and reduces accidental edits.
- Keeps “who should be notified” consistent with system automation.

If later requirements indicate a better model (e.g., a small admin-managed frontend sheet), the chosen model must still preserve an authoritative source and a deterministic sync path.

## 4. Schema and Table Rules
### 4.1 Header-Driven Schema (No Hardcoded Columns)
All table logic must be header-driven.

- Row 1 contains machine-friendly stable column identifiers.
- Tables start at row 2.
- Column positions must never be assumed.
- Code must locate columns by row-1 header values.

Display headers:
- Row 2 is the visible header row and may change without breaking logic.

Hidden helper columns:
- Additional hidden columns may be appended for internal computation.
- Hidden columns must be documented (purpose, source, and whether user-editable).

### 4.2 Normalization Rules
General normalization:
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace on user input.
- Normalize emails consistently (case and whitespace).
- Preserve valid name casing where possible (support names like “ben Yosef”).

### 4.3 Data Validation Strategy
All dropdown validations must be driven from the Data Legend tab(s) using ranges, not inlined lists.

- The Data Legend acts as the canonical option registry.
- Validations in other sheets reference Data Legend ranges.

Canonical option sets:
- The authoritative lists for dropdowns (AS years, flights, universities, dorms, CIP broad areas, AFSC options, attendance codes, etc.) are recorded in `docs/system/DATA_LEGEND_RANGES.md`.
- The Data Legend sheet(s) in each workbook must reflect these lists via stable named ranges.

## 5. Security and Access
### 5.1 Google Forms Identity
All system forms must require verified responder emails.

- Responder email is treated as the primary identity key.
- Any secondary identity fields (name) are used for human readability and additional matching but not as the sole identifier.

### 5.2 Sheet Protections
- Frontend: core tabs protected; editing reserved for scripts.
- Backend: protected with tighter editor set.

### 5.3 Secrets and IDs
- Never commit secrets.
- Avoid committing raw workbook/form IDs in public docs.
- IDs are configuration, not code logic.

## 6. Core Surfaces (Initial Scope)
This section describes the intended “shape” of the system so feature work stays consistent.

### 6.1 Frontend Tabs
- FAQs: two-column end-user information.
- Dashboard: links, metrics, charts, rotating upcoming birthdays, rotating “cadets out this week”.
- Cadre & Leadership: minimal contact directory.
- Directory: cadet directory (sorted Z-A by AS year, then A-Z by last name) with required formatting constraints.
- Attendance: directory-synced cadet rows + event columns with attendance codes and percentage rollups.
- Events: event metadata driving attendance columns and dashboard.
- Excusals: public-facing excusal request log.
- Audit/Changelog: append-only log of changes.
- Data Legend: validation option ranges.

### 6.2 Backend Tabs
- Directory Backend: authoritative directory source.
- Events Backend: authoritative events source.
- Excusals Backend: authoritative excusal workflow table.
- Attendance Backend: append-only attendance submission log.
- Audit Backend: authoritative audit log.
- Data Legend: canonical validation ranges.

## 7. Attendance System Model
The attendance system is a replayable pipeline.

- Submissions are recorded as immutable log rows in Attendance Backend.
- The Frontend Attendance matrix is derived by replaying logs plus excusal decisions.
- Rebuild/regenerate is an admin operation and must be deterministic.

Attendance codes:
- Codes map to credit, no-credit, pending, or excluded status.
- Blank means not yet taken / not applicable yet.

Percent metrics:
- LLAB attendance % is based on LLAB event subset.
- Overall attendance % is based on all applicable events.

## 8. Excusal System Model
Excusals are captured via a form and processed via backend decisions.

Workflow summary:
- Cadet submits request (includes event selection, reason, and PDF upload).
- Backend enriches flight/squadron from Directory.
- Decision is recorded by authorized staff.
- Decision propagates to attendance computation.
- Notifications are sent to appropriate leadership derived from Cadre & Leadership.

## 9. Audit / Changelog Expectations
Audit logging is required for key data mutations.

- Audit is append-only.
- Record actor identity, what changed, where, old/new values (as safe), and result.
- Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive data.

## 10. UX and Formatting Standards
Sheets are part UI, part database. Apply consistent formatting standards.

Required standards:
- Use Google Sheets Table feature for all primary tables.
- Row 1: machine headers (stable identifiers).
- Row 2: display headers.
- Conditional formatting where it improves operational clarity (e.g., attendance codes).
- Use borders and separators for readability (Directory requires specific separators).
- Use smart chips for links where helpful.

## 11. Menus, Triggers, and Operations
Operators should not run scripts from the editor.

- Provide custom menus for user/admin actions.
- Triggers should call stable, explicit entry points.
- Trigger installation must be idempotent.

## 12. Document Policy
- Public docs: explain how features work operationally without sensitive IDs.
- Internal docs: may describe system internals but still must avoid secrets.
- Every new feature must add or update:
  - A public feature entry
  - Any impacted system invariants in this spec
  - Operator runbook steps if operations change
