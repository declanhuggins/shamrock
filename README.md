# SHAMROCK

**System for Headcount & Accountability of Manpower, Readiness, Oversight, and Cadet Keeping**

This repository contains the **Apps Script codebase**, developed locally in **VS Code with TypeScript**, and deployed to Google Apps Script using **clasp**.

---

## Development quickstart
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Build TypeScript locally: `npm run build`
- Deploy to Apps Script: `npm run push` (requires `clasp` auth to the target script)
- Pull remote changes (if any): `npm run pull`
- Clean build output: `npm run clean`

## Documentation scaffolding
- AI workflow and conventions: `docs/AI_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md`
- Public-facing docs home: `docs/public/README.md`
- Feature doc template: `docs/templates/FEATURE_PUBLIC_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`

## Expected layout
- `src/` — TypeScript sources organized by domain (`forms/`, `sheets/`, `services/`, `triggers/`, `utils/`, `config/`, `types.ts`).
- `docs/` — internal/public documentation and templates.
- `dist/` — compiled Apps Script output (generated by `npm run build`).
